# Web Components SaasKit Demo Project

An vanilla Web Components SaasKit demo project.

## Motivation.

At my last job, we are developing front-end application using vanilla Web Components only without any external JavaScript libraries, and I want to use this project as a demo to show that it's completely doable and also interested to see what new things I will learn while working on this project. I will migrate [React TypeScript SaasKit](https://github.com/heybran/react-typescript-sasskit) to here with Web Components on frontend and Express as backend.

## Tech Stack

- Web Components
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL

## Planning

Need to start with base components and work my way up, components need to have accessiblity in mind, check [Vaadin Components](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/components) for inspiration.
